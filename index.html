    <h1>My Middle School Life</h1>
    <h2>6th Grade</h2>
      <text>
  <p>It’s the first day of 6th grade today. I walked into middle school looking as ordinary as possible and avoiding the suspicious kids and the mean ppl. I got my schedule and was not expecting the largest twist of my life to start here, in the next 3 years of my life.</p>
  <p>I sat down in 1st period like everyone else, but I found this rather interesting group with someone named William and someone named Harrison. I said hello to them and they were chill with me sitting there, things were going great. 2nd period rolled around on the first day and I had a chill Phys Ed class for that year, which we don't need to dig deeper into later on. Later on I went to my 3rd period, which was ELA and I loved that class so much. I had a nice teacher and very respectful classmates that understood my hobbies and needs. I left 3rd period in a good mood for the day and went to my 4th period class which was genuinely one of the best things I have ever experienced in middle school. 4th period was a literal utopia for me, the teacher let us play games a lot since the work was very easy and understandable. I met my favorite and wisest teacher I’ve ever had in 5th period. My social studies teacher is so funny and the way he teaches is simply just incredible, something I cannot forget even until now. Advisory did not start in the first week of school, but I think it’s going to be a fun and chill time for me to take a break. Science class was my 7th period and I have no words about it, it’s just your ordinary 6th grade class. 8th period is what I was waiting for for the entire day, band class. I walked into the band hall in my school and was shook by the amount of trophies and plaques we had. Simply just amazing how I got to be part of this incredible band.</p>
  <p>After the first day, I was looking forward to middle school. I biked to school in my 6th grade year and I actually enjoyed it, a long bike ride with uphills and downhills. Perfect for a morning workout before school starts. I got so used to the schedule on the 3rd day that I don’t care about my classes anymore, this year is going to be awesome. I loved my school chromebook so much since that was the only electronic device I had back then. Yes, it may be very slow and have the worst build quality known to humanity. I still loved it, simply amazing how you can browse the internet on a device that small. However, I discovered something on the 2nd day of school that would change my middle school personality forever. William showed me a website that lets you bypass the school firewall, and I was so shocked! I begged him to teach me how to make one of those. He said I want to keep this private so no, but William did install minecraft on my chromebook though. Something I did not know you can do.</p>
  <p>I basically spent the rest of my 6th grade year playing video games on this crappy old chromebook. Nothing too special this year, and I did not take any sports nor any extracurricular activities. We got our mouthpieces in band class on the 2nd week of school, everyone had to do a buzz test on it. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to buzz because it looked harder than I thought it would be. However, I did it flawlessly when it was my turn. I went home that day excited to try this newly discovered skill I found out I can do, just simple buzzing. 6th grade was not a year with huge jumps, but it was chill and peaceful.</p>
  <p>Time passed and I really had a deep thought to myself, “Wow, life is so boring and I am so depressed right now, I feel like there is nothing to do in 6th grade!” Then, I realized the answers are right in front of me, if you are bored, find a way to make it not boring! I started playing minecraft so much that I started my night gaming life. I played Minecraft until 2 AM at midnight, and I even played Roblox on my first ever phone that I got in November. It was a casual life and I did not care how I looked back then. I thought I would never care about how I look because looks are useless. Well, my opinion is about to change in exactly a year!</p>
  <p>December rolled around and my parents said we will go to New York for Christmas. I was shocked as soon as I heard that. NEW YORK? I’ve always wanted to see what it looks like in one of the largest cities in the world. So I spent December excited for the New York trip coming up later this month.</p>
  <p>There is this band audition called the “Select Band”, where if you make it you are basically the top 50% of the beginners in the band. Obviously I tried out for it, but I was not great at the tuba back then. 7 tubas auditioned and 5 made it. I felt like quitting band as it is not too late to quit yet, the school year just started. I decided it would be best to keep going, which ended up being the best decision I’ve made in my 3 years of middle school.</p>
  <p>Christmas rolled around and now it's time to go on vacation to New York. I have been counting on the trip for so long and it was my dream city to go back then. We took off early in the morning and arrived in the middle of the day. I was instantly shook when I stepped out of the New York subway and saw the bustling city outside. Our hotel was right in the middle of Times Square which made it even more exciting. The next 7 days are about to be the best 7 days of the year. What a great way to end 2023! I went to the Statue of Liberty, United Nations, 9/11 memorial, One World Trade Center, Times Square, and the Harry Potter thing.</p>
	When it was time to go back to school, I started a school business with a few friends in hope to make some money and buy stuff we want. The candies were selling great! We also ran subscriptions where $30 a month gets you a lot of candies, chips, and some more goodies. At the end of the year, we made $150 in total and we split it between the 3 of us, earning us $50 each. I was so sad to say goodbye to everyone as not a lot of my friends are staying in this school anymore. The year ended with the select band going on a trip to Dallas which made me regret more that I didn’t make the select band. Band auditions for the 7th grade school year rolled around, and I paid so much attention to my instrument with hopes of at least making the Symphonic band, which I actually did! With the year concluding with the spring concert and me getting mostly As and some Bs in my classes, it’s safe to say 6th grade would be hard to beat.</p>

    <h2>6-7th Grade Summer</h2>
      <text>
	<p>Summer was boring and I knew it would be boring from the start. I found a new hobby of aviation and I got so into it to the point I put an insane amount of work into it. Studying planes at night, playing very bad and easy to run flight simulators. I did not have the privilege of a good PC back then, but my mom did get me my first ever laptop without firewall restrictions and I finally got internet freedom at the late age of 12. Things were going great and I just love it, however, since summer is so perfect I knew it would end someday. So in mid-August, I went to 7th grade hoping for a good year, and my hopes did not come true at all.</p>

	<h2>7th Grade</h2>
      <text>
  <p>Another year, huh? I stepped into the school that I was so familiar with I could find any class instantly. It is the time of the year again where we get our schedules and hope that we see our friends in our classes. Sadly though, not a lot of friends were in my classes and it was filled with bullies and mean kids. The year was up to a rough start, and it's only been a week out of the 30 weeks in school. “This is going to suck!” I whispered to myself. I cried myself to sleep every night, I woke up every day depressed and angry at school. In the second half of 7th grade I always tried to fake being sick to not go to school, because the classes were bland and I got beat up all the time. One class I loved was fixing computers, which gave me nearly 40 minutes of free time every day to catch up on assignments or play a chill game. Since depression hit hard on me and I had to drag school around, I only showered if I even remembered to, did not pay attention in any of my classes, ate so much food and snacks all the time since there was nothing else to do, and went on a calorie rampage without paying any attention to my weight. After the first semester of 7th grade, I realized my weight is going out of hand, but I did not plan to lose any. Which ended up being one of the worst decisions of my life, not middle school my whole life. 6th grade ended with me being around 148 lbs, which was already a bit overweight as I was only 5 foot 4 back then. 7th grade ended with me weighing a whopping 170 lbs, which is pretty overweight despite me being 5 foot 8 at the end of 7th grade.</p>
  <p>A good thing is how I made the region band. There are 72 players in the symphonic band and only 2 of us successfully auditioned into the region band. I was so happy to the point I proved the haters wrong. People called me a sucker at my instrument and how I should’ve made a worse band instead. Well, after I made the region band, the haters shut up and moved on with their life. Never hating on anyone again. The band and choir holiday tour was very fun, we got to perform in elementary schools. Me and my friends raided the all you can eat buffet, it was pretty fun but I did feel bad for whoever that had to clean up like 12 plates. We also had to say goodbye to someone in our instrument section during the winter concert, bad memories.</p>
  <p>This year is just bad in general. Things did take a wild turn in winter break, where I got to go back to Asia, where I lived most of my life. I was so excited since it meant I will go on multiple flights. That is not a big deal but the big deal is that those flights are the first flights I will be on after becoming an aviation enthusiast. I paid attention to everything and filmed a lot of it, things did turn out pretty well and I spent my time in Asia eating very cheap food compared to American prices. After my 3 weeks in Asia, I was sad that I had to leave and go back to the 7th grade living hell. 7th grade took a steeper downhill when I came back, my friends turned on me because of a few mishaps between me and Harrison in 6th grade. My grades were also not in their best shape, it was horrible. 7th grade was insane caloric intake, late night gaming, fake friends, all sorts of fights, and I had a bad style.</p>
  <p>November was when stuff took a small turn though, I started my glow up in November. Obviously it ended up with people insulting my looks because glow ups can take a while before they look good. February hit and I kept on crying myself to sleep, thinking that I have no potential to look good with nothing good to live for. This is extreme, but I had strong thoughts to take my own life that year, and I actually almost took my own life in February. Something in my mind told me to keep going, so I listened to it, and now I am glad I kept going in life.</p>
  <p>The STAAR test hit and it really sucks to think how I will spend the next 7 hours locked in this room to take a boring test just to determine if I pass this school year. I walked into the testing room that day hoping I would not mess up, it is the ELA test today. The ELA test was not very hard, I basically did a speedrun through the 2nd half as it was pretty easy. A week later, I walked into the math test room and this girl just caught my eyes that morning. I didn’t think much about it at first, but after a few hours I noticed her nice personality around her friends. Her beautiful, dulcet voice, and how attractive she looks. After we were done with testing that day, I noticed her walking into the band hall after me. Wait a second, so you are telling me she was in the same band as me this whole year??? And I didn’t notice? Yeah, I did not expect that.</p>
  <p>Band audition day hit, and I hope I make the Honors Band. I waited a month for the results, and on result day, I sprinted to the band hall faster than anyone in my section and well… I MADE IT!</p>
  <p>Well, in 7th grade I learned that your life is the last thing you would want to lose. I also learned there is one simple rule in life: If you don’t go after what you want, you’ll never have it.</p>

	<h2>7-8th Grade Summer</h2>
	  <text>
	<p>This summer felt quick! I went to a band camp that I also went to last summer, it was amazing. For July 4th my family went to Austin, TX downtown and tried some insane stuff. We had band rehearsals basically every week during the summer and band camp at the end of the summer. To conclude the summer, I went to an AI summer camp and made my own AI app. Looking forward to 8th grade!</p>

	<h2>8th Grade</h2>
      <text>
  <p>The first day came, I walked into the school confidently with a good looking outfit and was stacked on supplies. I knew what I was doing and I knew where I was going. The first day was rough, with a lot of bullies in my class and a lot of racist kids. I explained this to the counselor and the counselor let me pick my own schedule since it was a horrible situation to be in. She also let me pick classes with friends, which meant I can have a fun year coming up. When I picked my new classes with my friends, I walked into the school happily the next day and knew who was in my classes. First period and I already have lots of people that I know in it. In 2nd period I loved how I made so many new friends just on the first day going to that class. The 3rd period was when I really paid attention. I was aware that my crush is in that class, but I did NOT expect to sit that close to her. It was mainly due to the fact that my friends chose the table, so shout-out to them for unknowingly helping me. I went on a work out streak and lost 11 lbs just in August, this year is going to be an insane year. Honors band is going great for me, I love the music that we will be playing this year. We are going to Seattle for a concert in November, which means we are going to the Museum of Flight, it is a once in a lifetime experience to go there.</p>
