    <h1>My Middle School Life</h1>
    <h2>6th Grade</h2>
      <text>It’s the first day of 6th grade today. I walked into middle school looking as ordinary as possible and avoiding the suspicious kids and the mean ppl. I got my schedule and was not expecting the largest twist of my life to start here, in the next 3 years of my life.
  I sat down in 1st period like everyone else, but I found this rather interesting group with someone named William and someone named Harrison. I said hello to them and they were chill with me sitting there, things were going great. 2nd period rolled around on the first day and I had a chill Phys Ed class for that year, which we don't need to dig deeper into later on. Later on I went to my 3rd period, which was ELA and I loved that class so much. I had a nice teacher and very respectful classmates that understood my hobbies and needs. I left 3rd period in a good mood for the day and went to my 4th period class which was genuinely one of the best things I have ever experienced in middle school. 4th period was a literal utopia for me, the teacher let us play games a lot since the work was very easy and understandable. I met my favorite and wisest teacher I’ve ever had in 5th period. My social studies teacher is so funny and the way he teaches is simply just incredible, something I cannot forget even until now. Advisory did not start in the first week of school, but I think it’s going to be a fun and chill time for me to take a break. Science class was my 7th period and I have no words about it, it’s just your ordinary 6th grade class. 8th period is what I was waiting for for the entire day, band class. I walked into the band hall in my school and was shook by the amount of trophies and plaques we had. Simply just amazing how I got to be part of this incredible band.
  After the first day, I was looking forward to middle school. I biked to school in my 6th grade year and I actually enjoyed it, a long bike ride with uphills and downhills. Perfect for a morning workout before school starts. I got so used to the schedule on the 3rd day that I don’t care about my classes anymore, this year is going to be awesome. I loved my school chromebook so much since that was the only electronic device I had back then. Yes, it may be very slow and have the worst build quality known to humanity. I still loved it, simply amazing how you can browse the internet on a device that small. However, I discovered something on the 2nd day of school that would change my middle school personality forever. William showed me a website that lets you bypass the school firewall, and I was so shocked! I begged him to teach me how to make one of those. He said I want to keep this private so no, but William did install minecraft on my chromebook though. Something I did not know you can do.
  I basically spent the rest of my 6th grade year playing video games on this crappy old chromebook. Nothing too special this year, and I did not take any sports nor any extracurricular activities. We got our mouthpieces in band class on the 2nd week of school, everyone had to do a buzz test on it. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to buzz because it looked harder than I thought it would be. However, I did it flawlessly when it was my turn. I went home that day excited to try this newly discovered skill I found out I can do, just simple buzzing. 6th grade was not a year with huge jumps, but it was chill and peaceful.
  Time passed and I really had a deep thought to myself, “Wow, life is so boring and I am so depressed right now, I feel like there is nothing to do in 6th grade!” Then, I realized the answers are right in front of me, if you are bored, find a way to make it not boring! I started playing minecraft so much that I started my night gaming life. I played Minecraft until 2 AM at midnight, and I even played Roblox on my first ever phone that I got in November. It was a casual life and I did not care how I looked back then. I thought I would never care about how I look because looks are useless. Well, my opinion is about to change in exactly a year!
  December rolled around and my parents said we will go to New York for Christmas. I was shocked as soon as I heard that. NEW YORK? I’ve always wanted to see what it looks like in one of the largest cities in the world. So I spent December excited for the New York trip coming up later this month.
  There is this band audition called the “Select Band”, where if you make it you are basically the top 50% of the beginners in the band. Obviously I tried out for it, but I was not great at the tuba back then. 7 tubas auditioned and 5 made it. I felt like quitting band as it is not too late to quit yet, the school year just started. I decided it would be best to keep going, which ended up being the best decision I’ve made in my 3 years of middle school.
  Christmas rolled around and now it's time to go on vacation to New York. I have been counting on the trip for so long and it was my dream city to go back then. We took off early in the morning and arrived in the middle of the day. I was instantly shook when I stepped out of the New York subway and saw the bustling city outside. Our hotel was right in the middle of Times Square which made it even more exciting. The next 7 days are about to be the best 7 days of the year. What a great way to end 2023! I went to the Statue of Liberty, United Nations, 9/11 memorial, One World Trade Center, Times Square, and the Harry Potter thing.
	When it was time to go back to school, I started a school business with a few friends in hope to make some money and buy stuff we want. The candies were selling great! We also ran subscriptions where $30 a month gets you a lot of candies, chips, and some more goodies. At the end of the year, we made $150 in total and we split it between the 3 of us, earning us $50 each. I was so sad to say goodbye to everyone as not a lot of my friends are staying in this school anymore. The year ended with the select band going on a trip to Dallas which made me regret more that I didn’t make the select band. Band auditions for the 7th grade school year rolled around, and I paid so much attention to my instrument with hopes of at least making the Symphonic band, which I actually did! With the year concluding with the spring concert and me getting mostly As and some Bs in my classes, it’s safe to say 6th grade would be hard to beat.

    <h2>6-7th Grade Summer</h2>
      <text>	Summer was boring and I knew it would be boring from the start. I found a new hobby of aviation and I got so into it to the point I put an insane amount of work into it. Studying planes at night, playing very bad and easy to run flight simulators. I did not have the privilege of a good PC back then, but my mom did get me my first ever laptop without firewall restrictions and I finally got internet freedom at the late age of 12. Things were going great and I just love it, however, since summer is so perfect I knew it would end someday. So in mid-August, I went to 7th grade hoping for a good year, and my hopes were somewhat true.
